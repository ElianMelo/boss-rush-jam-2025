      to bring them to justice, Agent. But they are dangerous people with a history
      of violent attacks and murder. It won\u2019t be surprising if they refuse to
      come peacefully."

      locations. Thanks to their technology, our recon drones failed to pick up anything
      useful. You will be going in blind."
